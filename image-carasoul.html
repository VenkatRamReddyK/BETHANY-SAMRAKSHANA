                                        Keeping it in mind we started a home [Mother's Nest] for the orphans/semi-orphans;</br>
                                        children picked up from streets and also children who are otherwise deprived of an opportunity to education due to parental negligence.</br>
                                        At present our temporary Shelter houses around 60 children out of which 28 are school going [Boys&Girls],</br>
                                        another 25 are children with special needs and few are going for vocational training.</br>
                                        These days there is a growing awareness among the youngsters regarding giving back to the society ,</br>
                                        but they do not know what to do and how to do. Here we are looking forward to your goodwill and</br>
                                        support to carry-on our mission of bringing about a smile on the faces of the less privileged.</br>
                                        Be our partners in creating a better society by providing better for the rural and a home for the homeless.</br>

                                        * Completion of the girl's home [as seen in in the above pic ]<br/>
                                        * For the time being this building  will serve as a make shift school which we are planning to start from the coming academic year i.e 2016-2017 [KG to 5th] till alternate building materializes.</br>
                                        * We also Urgently need a seperate home for the Boys and girls with special needs as the present one is too inadequate.</br>

                                        <h2>Boys Home:</h2></br>
                                        Due to lack of accommodation our boys and  a few girls are put up in two different rented houses.
